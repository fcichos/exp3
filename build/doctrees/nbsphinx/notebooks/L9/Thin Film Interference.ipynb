    "The reflection and transmission of waves on a thin film can also be regarded as an interference of two waves. A light wave is incident on a thin film as depicted below. A part of the wave is reflected on the first boundary (1). Another part is transmitted through the first boundary and reflected at the second boundary to be transmitted in the same direction (2) as the first reflected part. Note that the lines and arrows denote the direction of the wavevector $\\vec{k}$ of the partial waves. "

    "This picture of a single reflection at each of the interfaces is certainly a simplification and in general we would have to consider an infinite number of reflections. But if we assume that the reflection is weak (e.g. 4% as for the air/glass interface), then the next reflection would just diminish the 4% to 4% of 4%, which is really weak. So the two wave interference may be a good model for weak reflections. "
