    "So far we have looked at the propagation of light in form of ray's and its description in Gemoetrical Optics. We made a number of assumtions that we formulated as postulates. We then extended this description by a scalar Wave Optics description to allow for a description of interference and diffraction, which can not be explained by Geometrical Optics. Yet concepts of refractive index and light matter interaction and the intensities are not covered by Wave Optics and also just postulates. \n",

We discover light as electromagnetic waves consisting of electric and magnetic fields, which allow us to describe the interaction with charges in atoms, which is the foundation for the refractive index for example. The new thing is therefore the fact that we now need vectors for the description of light. "
