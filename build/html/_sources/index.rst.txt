Welcome to the Experimental Physik 3 Course!
============================================

In this Experimental Physics 3 course, we will dive into to basic experiments and mathematical descriptions related to light propagation, electromagnetic waves and its material counter part of matter waves. In particular we will have a look at 

* Geometrical Optics
* Wave Optics
* Electromagnetic Waves
* Matter waves and Quantum Mechanics

The fields of optics and quantum mechanics are nowadays very active research areas with a  dynamically devloping areas of optical technolgies, high resolution microscopy and quantum information. All this builds on the fundations that are tackled in this course.
