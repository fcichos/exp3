Welcome to the Experimental Physics 3 Course!
=============================================

In this Experimental Physics 3 course, we will dive into to basic experiments and mathematical descriptions related to light propagation, electromagnetic waves and its material counter part of matter waves. In particular we will have a look at 

* Geometrical Optics
* Wave Optics1
* Electromagnetic Waves
* Matter Waves and Quantum Mechanics

The fields of optics and quantum mechanics are nowadays very active research areas with a dynamically devloping field of optical technologies, high resolution microscopy and quantum information. All this builds on the fundations that are tackled in this course. To back up the lectures I further recommend **books** that are listed in the **resources section** of the website.
