    "So far we have discussed the models of the structural organization of atoms as proposed by *Thomson* also called *Plum Pudding Model* and proposed by *Rutherford*. We know that charges are not equally distributed across the volume of the atom (as assumed in the plum pudding model). Positive charges are rather comprised within a tiny volume, whereas negative charges form a shell around teh positive core. In detail, positive charges form the core with a diameter of $R_{\\mathrm{C}} < 10^{-14} \\; \\mathrm{m}$ and a total charge of $Q = Z\\cdot e$, where $Q$, $Z$, and $e$ denote the charge of the core or *nucleus*, the atomic number, and the elementary charge, respectively. In addition, the nucleus bears allmost the whole mass of the atome. In contrast to the positive charges forming heavy but small nucleus, the number of $Z$ electrons with a charge of $-e$ each form the *atomic shell*. The volume of the shell measures $10^{12}$ to $10^{15}$ times the volume of the nucleus and thus allmost the whole volume of the atome. In contrast, the mass of the shell is allmost vanishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will discuss how the atomic shell might be structured. One question is, whether the distribution of electrons is a static distribution of charges or whether the electrons move. The first case is not stable, because of the electrostatic attraction between the positive nucleus and the negative electrons. The second case, however, is puzzling as well, because accelerated and decelerated charges are supposed to emit electromagnetic waves which is not observed."

    "In 1859 Kirchhoff and Bunsen observed that atoms absorb light only  for particular values of the wavelength. Moreover these wavelength values are specific for the particular kind of atoms and form the absorption and emission spectra of these atoms. Early instruments for recording spectra made use of a prism as diffracting element and a photo plate for recording. The prism gave rise to a rainbow-colored stripe at the plate and narrow lines of reduced intensity appeard exactly at those positions that correspond to the particular wavelengths of atom absorption. Thus, the negative of the photo plates showed bright lines at these positions and those compositions of lines were called *line spectra*. On the basis of further experiments one was able to state\n",
