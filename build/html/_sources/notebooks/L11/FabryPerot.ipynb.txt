    "The refractive index for a anti-reflection coating is thus given as the square root of the product of the neighboring materials refractive indices. Thus for example, if we use $n_1=1$ (air) and $n_3=1.5$ (glass), then we obtain $n_2=1.22$ for the appropriate coating refractive index. Unfortunately refractive indices rely on materials and are not completely arbitrary. Therefore, we have to choose one of the robust materials, that is closest to this value, which is in this case $Mg F_2$ with $n_2=1.38$, which brings down reflection far enough. Better performance, also across larger ranges of wavelength, is obtained with multilayer structures.\n"

    "Photonic crystals take the idea of periodic structures now to three dimensions. If we create a periodic structure much like and atomic lattice just out of dielectric units, which interact with light, we obtain a complex interference structure depending on the direction of wave propagation. This creates directions under which propagation is leading to complete transmission and others where there is complete reflections. This relation between wavenumber and frequency for which a propagation is leadint to transmission is called the dispersion relation and this is plotted in a band diagram. Such a band structure diagram is completely equivalent to what you may know about the propagation of electrons in an atomic lattice. "

The graph on the right side is the dispersion relation for this colloidal crystal structure and very simular to the dispersion relation for electrons in a real crystal. The difference is, that light typically has a linear disperion (see from the point $\\Gamma$) while for electrons this dispersion starts quadratic."
