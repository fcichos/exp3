Assignments
===========

All of the assignments of the lecture will be handled in moodle. An assigment will be handed out every week starting the 17.October 2022 in the afternoon. The assignment will be due the week after before the lecture until 11:00 o'clock. All assignments will be corrected and the solution to the individual problems will be discussed in the seminar one week later. 

**To take part in the final exam you need 50% (sharp!) of the total point possible.**

The video below tells you how to access the assignments and how to submit the solutions.
