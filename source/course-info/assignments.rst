Assignments
===========

All of the assignments of the lecture will be handled in moodle_. An assigment will be handed out every week starting on October 26, 2020 in the afternoon. The assignment will be due the week after before the lecture until 11:00 am. All assignments will be corrected and the solution to the individual problems will be discussed in the seminar one week later. 

**To take part in the final exam you need 50 % (sharp!) of the total points possible.**

The video below tells you how to access the assignments and how to submit the solutions.
