Assignments
===========

All of the assignments of the lecture will be handled in paper. An assigment will be handed out every week starting the 17.October 2022 in the afternoon and will be available online at the MONA Webpage. The assignment will be due the week after before the Thursday lecture until 11:00 o'clock. If you do not manage to hand the assignment in before the lecture, please use our **mailbox**. All assignments will be corrected and the solution to the individual problems will be discussed in the seminar one week later. 

**To take part in the final exam you need 50% (sharp!) of the total point possible.**
