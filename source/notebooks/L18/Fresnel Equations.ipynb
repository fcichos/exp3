    "The imaginary -xcomponent of the wavevector is creating a real valued factor for the amplitude of the electric field in the transmission region. The electric field in this region is decaying exponentially with the distance $x$ from the interface. Yet, the field is only osciallting along the interface but not in the x-direction. Such an exponentially decaying field without oscialltion is called **evanescent wave**. Equivalent exponential decays do also exist in quantum mechanics, however, they concern in this case the decay of the probability to find a particle inside a region. \n",

    "The image below shows the electric field (left) and the intensity (right) for the total internal reflection at a boundary between glass and air, which the exponential decay is nicely visible for the electric field. To calculate the intensity, we would have to calculate the Poynting vector. As it turns our, the Pyonting vector is zero in the transmission region and hence there is no energy flow in the transmission region. Nevertheless, there is a time oscillating electric field and we may calculate the magnitude square of the electric field decay, which is shown in the right figure."

Evanescent field play an important role for optical microscopy for example, where they are either used in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF), exciting only a tiny sheet above an interface and thus reducing fluorescence background. Other techniques use the evanescent field on tiny tips as sources for excitation of fluorescence or scattering (NSOM). Evanescent waves are also used for coupling light into small mechanical resonators to cool them to extremely low temperatures (opto-mechanics). "
