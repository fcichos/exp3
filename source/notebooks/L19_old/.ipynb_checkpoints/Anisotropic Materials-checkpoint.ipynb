The image on the left side shows an interface between air on the bottom and the anisotropic material on the top. The wavevector is incident from below and is normal zo the surface. Its direction will intersect both k-surfaces and thereby select the ordinary refractive index and the extra-ordinary refractive index for the two different polarization directions. Both waves propgate in the same direction, so their wavefronts are perpendicular to the k-vectors as shown in the middle sketch. Yet, the Poynting vectors go in different direction. The Poynting vector, which points in the direction of energy propagation, is always perpendicular to the k-surface, since the k-surface is an isoenergy surface *(think about that for a moment)*.

This phenomenon is called birefringence and separates two orthogonal polarizations into two beams as indicated. \n",
