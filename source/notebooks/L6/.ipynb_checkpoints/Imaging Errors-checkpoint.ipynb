    "During our derivation of the imaging equation for lenses and the lens-maker equation we have been working under the paraxial approximation. This approximation stated, that all rays are close to the optical axis and therefore make only small angles with the surface normals of the curved surfaces of lenses (but also mirrors). If we violate this approximation, i.e. if we use rays, which are incident for from the optical axis or strongly inclined, then we end up with reflections and refraction which do not obey the imaging equation. In addition we have seen that light propagation for different colors is subject to different refractive indices (remember the prism). Thus we will induce aberrations, related to color."

If we insert an aperture behind the lens, the central ray will not be able to pass but other rays, which create an area around $M_1$, which is at larger distance than $M$ from the optical axis. Now, the larger the point $A_0$ is from the optical axis, the larger is also the distance of $M_1$ from $M$ and the optical axis. This turns a regular grid like in th eexperiment above into a cushion shaped object.
