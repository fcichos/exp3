Think of that for a moment, that this performance is given with a few 10 W power consumption and then turn around your laptop and check out its power consumption. \n",

The cone density peaks around this center, while the ro density is larger outside. COnes are the color sensitive objects, which gain their light sensitive from a dye molecules called *retinal* undergoing a conformational transition upon excitation with light. This trigges a cascasde of different chemical processes. Cones with three narrow excitation ranges allow our color vision (see Fig. below)."

However. the lens of the eye may have defects changing its refractive power. Often this leads to short-sightedness or far-sightedness. If you are short-sighted, the light from infinite distance is not focused to the retina but to some shorter distance inside the glass body. This may be corrected by a concave lens as displayed in the image below on the left side. If you are far-sighted, then the light is focused behind the retina if objects are ininitely distant away. To correct for that error, one needs a convex lens as displayed on the right side."
