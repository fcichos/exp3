    "Most of the optical instruments consist of multiple lenses that are used to image objects or to magnify them. They are combined at distances, which are either larger or smaller than the sum of their focal distances. The image below shows for example an artifical image of a lens system contained in a single microscope objctive lens, where you see multiple elements e.g. doublets and triplets of lenses. These elements as joined objects may considerably improve the performance of the optics, e.g. correct for imaging errors. "

    "Following this equation the inverse of the total focal length of the combined lenses is just the sum of its inverse focal distances minus a term, which depends on the distance of the two lenses. If this distance is small as compared to the focal length, i.e. the lenses are close to each other, the total inverse focal is just given by the first two terms. The inverse focal distances characterize the refractive power of a lens. The larger the invserse value, the smaller is the focal distance. This refractive power is commonly measured in the unit **diopter**. One diopter corresponds to **1 dpt=1 $m^{-1}$**."

A whole system of different lenses, plates and other optical elements can thus be treated as a matrix multiplication, which is quite useful. "
