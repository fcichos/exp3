    "In 1888 Wilhelm Hallwachs published the result that metal plates irradiated with UV light become positively charged. He explained this results through teh emission of electrons which was the foundation of the explanation of the photoelectric effect. Later in 1902 Lennard measured the photocurrent between two plates in vacuum. The current did set in already at a negative voltage $U_0$ between the plates und reached a plateau which depended only on the light's intensity. He concluded the kinetic energy of the electrons is $E_{\\mathrm{kin}} \\le e \\cdot U_0$ and further\n",

    "- The number of photoelectronis proportional to the light's intensity.\n",
    "- There is no delay between light irradiation and electron emission.\n",
    "In 1905, then, Einstein explained these findings on the basis of the quantum model of light. In accord to this model every absorbed quantum of energy transfers its energy $h \\cdot \\nu$ completely to **one** electron. The maximum kinetic energy of an electron is then governed by $E_{\\mathrm{kin}}^{\\mathrm{max}} = h \\cdot \\nu - W_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ,with $W_{\\mathrm{a}} = -e \\left( \\phi_{\\mathrm{vac}} - \\phi \\right)$ being the work function of one electron. The work function can be determined by means of the voltage $U_0$ at which the photocurrent sets in $E_{\\mathrm{kin}}^{\\mathrm{max}} = -e\\cdot U_0$ with $U_0 < 0$.\n",
