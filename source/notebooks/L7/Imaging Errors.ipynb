    "During our derivation of the imaging equation for lenses and the lensmaker equation we have been working under the paraxial approximation. This approximation stated that all rays are close to the optical axis and, therefore, make only small angles with the surface normals of the curved surfaces of lenses (but also mirrors). If we violate this approximation, i.e., if we use rays which are incident from the optical axis or strongly inclined, then we end up with reflections and refraction which do not obey the imaging equation. In addition we have seen that light propagation for different colors is subject to different refractive indices (remember the prism). Thus, we will induce aberrations, related to color."

Considering those rays one finds that the meridional rays are focused to a point closer to the lens as compared to the sagittal rays, which are focused to a point at farther distance.

If we insert an aperture behind the lens, the central ray will not be able to pass but other rays, which create an area around $M_1$, which is at larger distance than $M$ from the optical axis. Now, the larger the point $A_0$ is from the optical axis, the larger is also the distance of $M_1$ from $M$ and the optical axis. This turns a regular grid like in the experiment above into a cushion shaped object.
