    "In 1888 Wilhelm Hallwachs published an experiment with charged foils connected to a metal plate which was irradiated with ultraviolet light (we did this experiment in the last lecture before Christmas). If the foils and the plate are negatively charged and electrically isolated against the surrounding, the charge do decrease upon irradiation with ultraviolet light. In constrast, if the system is positively charged, the charge does not decrease. Hallwachs concluded that the light is responsible for negative charges leaving the metal plate.\n",

They used small, charged bismuth beads holded within a Millikan capacitor and irradiated those beads with low-dose X-rays.

The calculated time constant of $Z$ was in well agreement with the observed rate of the charge alterarion. If we again assume a wave-like explanation of teh photoeffect, the emitted power within the according solid anngle will be absorbed by the bead and distributed between all its elctrons. As a consequnce the bead as a whole will have collected enough energy in order release an electron within the same period of time. However it cannot be explained how all $10^{12}$ atoms are supposed to combine their energy in one, sinblge electron at the very same time."

    "During the 18th century there was a dispute about the nature of light. *Newton* proposed a particle-like character on the basis of the straight propagation and the law of refraction. In contrast, *Huygens* proposed a wave-like character of light on the basis of interference and diffraction. This interpretation seemed to be proven when Heinrich Hertz discovered electromagnetic waves and light was interpreted as a special spectral region being as well governed by Maxwell's equations. As we have seen on the basis of the experiemnts, light --and more general electromagnetic waves-- might show corpuscular characteristics as well. That is why we have to introduce a particle-like description in additon to the allready known wave-like description. "
