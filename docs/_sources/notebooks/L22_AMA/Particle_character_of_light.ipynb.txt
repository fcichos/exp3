    "In 1888 Wilhelm Hallwachs published an experiment with charged foils connected to a metal plate which was irradiated with ultraviolet light (we did this experiment in the last lecture before Christmas). If the foils and the plate are negatively charged and electrically isolated against the surrounding, the charge do decrease upon irradiation with ultraviolet light. In constrast, if the system is positively charged, the charge does not decrease. Hallwachs concluded that the light is responsible for negative charges leaving the metal plate.\n",

    "Later in 1902 Lennard measured the photocurrent between two plates in vacuum. The current set in already at a negative voltage $U_0$ between the plates, incresed with rising voltage, and reached a plateau which depended only on the light's intensity. He concluded:\n",

    "One example for an experiment proving Einstein's explanation of the photoeffect was provided by von JoffÃ© und Dobronrawov in 1925. They used small, charged bismuth beads holded within a Millikan capacitor and irradiated those beads with low-dose X-rays. Every change of the overall charge of the beads interfere the equilibrium in the capacitor, and can be observed by means of a change of the bead position. Using a radiation power of $P = 10^{-12} \\; \\mathrm{W}$ meaning an emission rate of $\\dot{N} = 10^3$ photons per second with an energy of $h \\cdot \\nu = 10^4 \\; \\mathrm{eV}$ on average every 30 minutes a change of the bead charge was detected. The number of photons arriving at one bead within a time intervall $\\Delta t$ is $Z = \\dot{N} \\cdot \\Delta t \\cdot \\mathrm{d} \\Omega/ \\left( 4\\pi \\right)$, whith $\\mathrm{d} \\Omega$ as the solid angle covered by the bead. The calculated time constant of $Z$ was in well agreement with the observed rate of the charge alterarion. If we again assume a wave-like explanation of teh photoeffect, the emitted power within the according solid anngle will be absorbed by the bead and distributed between all its elctrons. As a consequnce the bead as a whole will have collected enough energy in order release an electron within the same period of time. However it cannot be explained how all $10^{12}$ atoms are supposed to combine their energy in one, sinblge electron at the very same time."
