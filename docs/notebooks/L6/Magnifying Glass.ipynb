    "A magnifying glass has several applications. First of all, it allows to see objects with details that would otherwise be too small to be observed with the eye even of the eye lens can accomodate to the distances. Such magnifying glasses are also used in microscopes as the so-called **eye-piece** as we will later see in the section on microscopes."

    "Consider the sketch below. The sketch shows an object of a size $A$ which is at a distance of $s_0$ from the eye. The object makes an angle $\\epsilon_0$ with the optical axis. If we insert now a lens into the space between object and eye and the lens is positioned in a way that it is exactly at a distance $f$ (the focal distance of the lens) from the object then we are able to observe the object under a different angle $\\epsilon$."

    "A second very useful effect is that when the object is placed inside the focal distance from the lens, the eye images a virtual image at infinite distance to the retina (see sketch).
