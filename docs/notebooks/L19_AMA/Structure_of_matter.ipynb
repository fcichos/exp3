    "The oldest documents about the structure of matter being composed of infinite small, but space-filling particles originate from the Greek philosophers *Leukip* and *Demokrit*. Those particles differ in size and shape, and properties of objects on the macroscopic scale arise from the arrangement of these particles. Since they assumed these particles are indivisible, they named them \"*$\\alpha \\tau o \\mu o \\zeta$\" (atoms). One century later, *Epikur* refined the picture of atoms through ascribing the characteristic of mass to these particles, in addition to space demand."

    "On the basis of precise quantitative analyses of chemical reaction and the ratios of educts and products, John Dalton developed the idea that every chemical compound is composed of substances, whereas the ratio of these substance is constant for a particular compound and the ratio unambiguously identifies a compound. In 1803 Dalton developed his idea of a chemical reaction being the separation and association of atoms, and published this idea in 1808 \"*A New System of Chemical Philosophy*\". This publication stated three postulates:\n",
    "- All chemical elements are composed of small particles which cannot be dismantled any further.\n",
    "- All atoms of the same chemical element are identical in quality, size, and mass. However, these properties differ from the according properties of other elements. Consequently, the characteristics of an element are governed through the properties of its atoms.\n",
    "- If chemical elements form a chemical compounds, their atoms associate in a ratio of integers."

    "In 1811 Amadeo Avogadro introduced the term \"molecule\" as smallest particle of a gas which has the same characteristics as the gas itself. As a consequence Avogadro stated that at identical pressure and temperature equally big volumes of different gasses contain the same number of molecules. On the basis of his experimental findings, the term \"molar volume\" was introduced. The first definition was molar volume is the volume of 1 mol of a gas at standard conditions ($p = 1013\\mbox{ hPa}, T = 0 \\mbox{ C}^{\\circ}$), whereas the weight of the gas in gramm corresponds to the molecular weight of the gas molecules. The modern, general definition of 1 mol is the number of particles which corresponds to 12 g of carbon ${}^{12}\\mbox{C}$ and is valid for non-gaseous substances as well. The molar volume is $V_{\\mathrm{M}} = 22.414\\mbox{ l}$ and the Avogadro number $N_{\\mbox{A}} = 6.022 \\cdot 10^{23} \\mbox{ mol}^{-1}$.\n",

    "At the end of the 19th century experimental findings accumulated indicating matter bears charged particles. The main results were:\n",
    "- Experiments on electrolytic current demonstrated that molecules can dissociate, whereas the resulting ions migrate in opposite directions and transport charges and mass.\n",
    "- Gas dicharging phenomena are influenced through electric and magnetic fields. Thus, discharging is correlated to motion of charged particles.\n",
    "- Magnetic phenomena arise from electric conduction in metals and semiconductors.\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ radiation are deflected through magnetic fields; $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ particles are positively charged, heavy particles and negatively charged, light particles, respectively.\n",
    "Consequently the concept of matter being composed of atoms was extended. Atoms in turn consist of positively and negatively charged particles which bear mass and charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Johann Wilhelm Hittorf observed in a gas discharge tubes that particles emitted from a cathode propagate at straight lines. Moreover, these particles can be deflected with the aid of a magnet. As a consequence of the emission from the cathode and the direction of the magnetic poles, these particles had to be negatively charged. Later in 1897, Joseph John Thomson determined the charge-to-mass ratio $e/m$ and demonstrated that this ratio is independent of the cathode material. In constrast to charged particles emitted from the cathode, Eugen Goldstein observed in 1886 a ray emitted from the anode which is propagating in the opposite direction than the cathode ray. In 1887 Wilhelm Wien reported from a $10^{-4}$ reduced charge-to-mass ratio of this anode ray and concluded that these particles are charged gas ions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1899 Thomson and Charles Wilson studied sinking droplets of condensed water vapor. The speed of falling was depending on the size of the droplets and the viscosity of the retarding gas. While measuring the amount of water and charges Thomson and Wilson were able to estimate the elementary charge of about $10^{-19} \\mbox{ C}$. In 1910 Robert Andrews Millikan studied oil droplets rising and falling in a capacitor. On the basis of this method, the elementary charge is determined as $e = 1.602\\cdot 10^{-19} \\mbox{ C}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning the mass of an electron, its value is still only accessible via the charge-to-mass ratio. A precise measurement of the $e/m$ ratio is possible with a Wien filter. To do so, an electron is accelerated by means of a voltage, whereas perpendicular to the propagation direction an electric filed deflects the electron beam. In addition a magnetic field is used to compensate the deflection. Thus, the $e/m$ ratio depends only on the applied accelerating voltage and the electric and magnetic fields."
