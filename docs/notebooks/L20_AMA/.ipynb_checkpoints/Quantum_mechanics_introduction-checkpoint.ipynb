    "In 1888 Wilhelm Hallwachs published the result that metal plates irradiated with UV light become positively charged. He explained this results through teh emission of electrons which was the foundation of the explanation of the photoelectric effect. Later in 1902 Lennard measured the photocurrent between two plates in vacuum. The current did set in already at a negative voltage $U_0$ between the plates und reached a plateau which depended only on the light's intensity. He concluded the kinetic energy of the electrons is $E_{\\mathrm{kin}} \\le e \\cdot U_0$ and further\n",
